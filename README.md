All the shapes you see are plug-ins.  The behaviours and lighting are also plug-ins.Apart from the plug-ins, the other major differences are:* Loading of levels is now done by including the Oglr.InGame assembly   (there's versions for Windows, XBox, and Windows Phone), and creating a `LevelLoader` object.* When a Level is loaded, nothing is drawn.  The previous version drew textures,   but this one doesn't. Create your own in-game objects to do the drawing.Although the format of the files have changed, **you can still import your old Gleed files** and save them in the new format.======License info:Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL)This license governs use of the accompanying software.
