 - IN THE FUTURE
Move the Level out into a Model namespace and have MainForm/Level/Canvas reference that instead of having Level 'own' it.
View XML in the View menu
Move context menu creation to items so that custom items can have custom menus
Move resources out of MainForm and into their respective controls.
Have custom editors be responsible	for their own controls/tabs, e.g. have the texture plugin be responsible for creating the window and file system watcher
bug: layer_0 remains in imported level
Move Camera from Editor to Level (and have it update the property grid)
Draw a focus box when canvas (Editor) is focused
Arrow keys move editors around
Copy/Paste of items
Dependency properties - e.g. Krypton can add a 'has light' property to other objects (e.g. rectangles, textures)
X ** Build an editor for the Krypton components, including 'Hull' and 'Light' and possibly 'Ambient' **
Plugins should be able to add menu items to the propert grid context menu
Icons when drawing on the Canvas - e.g. a Hull icon for the Hulls and a Light icon for the lights
Remove 'Position' from Layer - Position is not applicable to everything that derives from it, e.g. layer/level
Different icon for 'CanRotate' if can't rotate an item
